# ArtifactBuildOptimizer
ABO is a program that will allow players of STALKER 2 to make sure they are using a correct artifact build for their suit of armor.

In the app you will be prompted to:
* Select your suit of armor
* Provide how many artifact slots/ lead containers your armor has (Starting from the base amount, up to the max upgrades possible)
* Select the artifacts that you currently have.
* Choose what kind of build you want generated from those artifacts (Balanced, Anomaly Protections, Endurance, Bleed Resistance, and Weight)
* The app will then generate 2 builds for you.
  * The build shown will be using the artifacts that you had previously selected.
  * The "Alternate Build" will be a build that consists of every single artifact. Think of this as the "Best possible build" for your suit of armor.
